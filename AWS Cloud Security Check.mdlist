# AWS Cloud Security Comprehensive Checklist

## **I. Infrastructure Protection**

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Security

    - Every single service in your architecture should live within a VPC.
    - Use specific NACL Inbound and Outbound rules.
    - Use Security Group Inbound and Outbound rules with IP whitelisting.
    - Enable VPC flow logs to CloudWatch.
    - Public subnets with controlled internet access.
    - Private subnets for services with no internet access.
    - Keep databases in private subnets.

### 1. **VPC Configuration**

**Test Case**: Ensure VPCs are correctly configured and don't allow unrestricted inbound or outbound traffic.

**Methods**: Review your VPC settings, especially the security group rules and network access control lists (NACLs). They should be tightly controlled to allow only necessary traffic to/from resources.

**Tools**: Use AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to check VPC configurations.

### 2. **Unused VPCs**

**Test Case**: Check for any unused VPCs and remove them.

### 3. **Isolation of Resources**

**Test Case**: Ensure that your resources are isolated correctly. Databases, application servers, and other sensitive resources should be in private subnets that are not directly reachable from the internet.

**Methods**: Segment your resources into separate subnets and utilize subnet security groups. For example, databases should be stored in private subnets without route tables leading to an internet gateway.

**Tools**: AWS Management Console, AWS CLI

### 4. **Encryption of Traffic**

**Test Case**: Check whether traffic between your VPC and on-premises resources is encrypted, especially if sensitive data is communicated.

**Methods**: Setting up a VPN connection or using AWS Direct Connect with a private virtual interface.

**Tools**: AWS VPC VPN Connections, AWS Direct Connect 

### 5. **VPC Flow Logs**

**Test Case**: Ensure VPC Flow Logs are enabled for monitoring and troubleshooting security and network issues.

**Methods**: Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture information about IP traffic in your VPC. Following this, monitor the logs for unusual traffic patterns or security issues.

**Tools**: AWS VPC Flow Logs, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3

### 6. **Default VPC Security**

**Test Case**: Ensure default security settings are tightened. By default, all VPCs come with a default security group that allows all outbound traffic and all inbound traffic from instances assigned to the same security group.

**Methods**: Customise the inbound and outbound traffic rules of your default security group and avoid using it for new instances.

**Tools**: AWS Management Console, AWS CLI

### 7. **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**

**Test Case**: Ensure that your NACLs are configured to allow only necessary traffic and block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.

**Methods**: Review and update the inbound and outbound rules in your NACLs.

**Tools**: AWS Management Console, AWS CLI

### 8. **Security Group Configuration**

**Test Case**: Check if security group rules allow traffic from unknown or large IP ranges.

**Methods**: Limit the IP ranges allowed in your inbound and outbound rules. Ensure you are allowing traffic only from trusted and necessary IP addresses or ranges.

**Tools**: AWS Management Console, AWS CLI

## **9. VPC Peering Connections**
