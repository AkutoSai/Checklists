# Comprehensive IP Camera VAPT Checklist

## Physical Security Assessment
- [ ] Check the physical security measures implemented to protect the IP camera (e.g., tamper-proof casing, secure mounting).
- [ ] Ensure the camera is placed in an optimal position to cover the desired area.
- [ ] Verify that the camera is not easily accessible or removable by unauthorized individuals.

## Network Configuration Assessment
- [ ] Identify the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway configured for the IP camera.
- [ ] Check for any default or weak login credentials.
- [ ] Review the network configuration for secure protocols such as HTTPS, SSH, or VPN.
- [ ] Ensure the camera firmware is up to date with the latest security patches.
- [ ] Network segmentation and isolation to assess if the camera is properly segregated from critical network segments.

## Authentication and Authorization Testing
- [ ] Test the strength of login credentials (e.g., username and password) against common passwords, dictionary attacks, and brute-force attacks.
- [ ] Verify the implementation of account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
- [ ] Test if the camera enforces strong password requirements (e.g., length, complexity).
- [ ] Check for the presence of default accounts and ensure they are either disabled or have unique, strong passwords.
- [ ] Validate the effectiveness of access control mechanisms (e.g., user roles, permissions).

## Web Interface Testing
- [ ] Identify the web interface used to manage the IP camera.
- [ ] Test for common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- [ ] Validate input sanitization and parameter validation to prevent unauthorized access or command execution.
- [ ] Test for vulnerabilities related to session management, including session hijacking or fixation.
- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of SSL/TLS implementation and check for the use of secure ciphers.
- [ ] Testing for vulnerabilities introduced by integrated services or features (e.g., cloud storage, remote access protocols).

## Mobile Application Testing
- [ ] Identify the mobile application used to remotely access the IP camera.
- [ ] Test the mobile application for common vulnerabilities such as insecure data storage, insecure communication, and weak authentication.
- [ ] Validate the integrity of the mobile application by checking for tampering or reverse engineering attempts.
- [ ] Test the application's resistance to mobile-specific threats, including rooted/jailbroken devices, malicious app injection, and repackaging attacks.
- [ ] Verify that access controls and permissions are properly enforced within the mobile application.
- [ ] Testing for vulnerabilities introduced by integrated services or features (e.g., cloud storage, remote access protocols).

## Video and Audio Data Transmission
- [ ] Check if the video and audio data transmitted from the IP camera to the viewing application are encrypted.
- [ ] Verify the use of secure protocols such as Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for audio and Transport Layer Security (TLS) for video.
- [ ] Assess the camera's susceptibility to eavesdropping or tampering of transmitted data.
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords or user credentials, are not transmitted in cleartext.

## Firmware and Device Hardening
- [ ] Evaluate the security measures implemented in the IP camera's firmware, such as secure boot, signed firmware updates, and firmware encryption.
- [ ] Test for known vulnerabilities in the camera's firmware version.
- [ ] Verify the absence of backdoors or undocumented features that could compromise the camera's security.
- [ ] Assess the camera's resilience against physical attacks, firmware extraction, or tampering.
- [ ] Evaluate the camera's firmware update process for security measures such as code signing, secure distribution channels, and integrity checks.
- [ ] Test the camera's response to firmware downgrade attempts to ensure that it rejects older or unauthorized firmware versions.
- [ ] Verify if the camera has a mechanism for remote firmware updates and check the security of the update process.
- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of secure boot mechanisms to prevent unauthorized or tampered firmware from being loaded.
- [ ] Test the resilience of the camera against physical attacks, such as attempts to extract firmware or gain unauthorized access to internal components.
- [ ] Check for the presence of debug interfaces or test points that may provide unauthorized access or control over the camera.
- [ ] Verify if the camera implements secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for remote management and configuration.
- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of access controls and permissions within the camera's firmware, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify settings.
- [ ] Test the camera's ability to handle firmware updates in the presence of limited resources, such as low storage or low power conditions.
- [ ] Verify if the camera has implemented mechanisms to protect against buffer overflows, stack-based or heap-based vulnerabilities, or other common firmware vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Assess the camera's response to abnormal conditions, such as power outages or network interruptions, to ensure it recovers securely and continues operating as expected.
- [ ] Check if the camera supports encryption for stored data, such as video footage, and verify the strength of the encryption algorithms and key management.
- [ ] Evaluate the camera's logging and auditing capabilities, ensuring that important security events and actions are properly logged and protected from tampering.
- [ ] Test the camera's ability to detect and respond to malicious activities or attacks, such as tampering with the firmware or unauthorized access attempts.
- [ ] Testing for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or software components used by the camera's firmware.

## Privacy and Data Protection
- [ ] Ensure the camera complies with relevant privacy regulations and data protection standards (e.g., GDPR).
- [ ] Verify that the camera does not collect or store more data than necessary for its intended purpose.
- [ ] Assess the camera's handling of sensitive user data, including encryption, secure storage, and proper access controls.
- [ ] Test for vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access to stored video footage or audio recordings.
- [ ] Verification of compliance with industry standards and best practices for secure coding and firmware development.

## Vulnerability Assessment and Reporting
- [ ] Perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing using automated tools and manual techniques.
- [ ] Document and prioritize discovered vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
- [ ] Provide a detailed report that includes identified vulnerabilities, potential exploits, and recommended remediation measures.
